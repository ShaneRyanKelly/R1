This is a simple compiler written in C designed to support a number of functions
 and operations. This compiler compiles to a 16-bit assembly language for a simple
 register-oriented architecture. The compiler may be compiled from the s3.c source
 code found in this directory. S3.s is the input file for the compiler which
 includes unary plus, addition, subtraction, and multiplication operations as well
 as a println() output function.

The output file, S3.a is included to demonstrate the compiler's capabilities and
 output.
